# CRUx Induction tasks
### The repository that contains the tasks that have been required for me to complete in order to join the CRUx Coding club.
## Implementation details:
### Task 1: VM-Calc
- This is currently an extension of a project that I was previously working on: https://github.com/soemone/vm-calc
- There have been many changes and this version could be considered an improvement over that implementation
- Notable changes to VM-Calc:
    - Implement haskell-like partial function calls, read the README.md of the folder to learn more
    - Implement arrays (possibly a bad implementation), again, look through the respective README.md to learn more
    - You may now see the parsed output (Not as a tree, but as a formatted set of expressions that very much looks like the input) as well as the underlying instruction code
    - Reduced the number of errors the parser handles, allowing the VM to handle the rest. A degradation in performance, perhaps.

### Task 2: issui
- A basic TUI wrapper for the GitHub CLI, to view issues associated with user repositories
